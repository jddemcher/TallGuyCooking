# Ham and Bean Soup

*This is a very simple recipe for ham and bean soup, it can be easily modified and adjusted to personal preference or availability of ingredients.*

### Ingredients
1. Ham shank, Hamhock, or leftover ham bone
2. Extra ham steak (optional)
3. 1LB great northern beans
4. 1/2 LB navy beans
5. tomato paste (half to 1/3 of the smallest can you can find)
6. fresh garlic or canned/jarred minced garlic
7. carrots, about 1lb
8. celery, 1 stock
9. yellow onion (might need 2 depending on size)
10. white potatoes 3 or 4 depending on size (optional)

### Cooking Instructions

1. Place beans in a bowl and fill with water until they are just barely covered, then let sit on counter covered with wrap or foil for about 3 or 4 hours.
2. While beans are soaking, dice the vegetables. I like to blend the carrots, but they can be cut whichever way is preferred. If you have an extra ham steak, you can dice that as well.
3. About halfway through when the beans are soaking, begin making the broth/stock. In a large pot, fill with water and a few tablespoons of olive oil if you have it, place the ham shank/hamhock in the water and bring to a boil. I like to place some of the minced garlic and chopped onion, and the leaves of the celery stock in with the ham while it is boiling. Once it begins to boil, back the heat off to just above medium and let simmer for an hour or two.
4. After about an hour or two, remove the ham shank/hamhock and any celery leaves. Let the ham cool a bit, then cut off all the meat and dice up as best you can. 
5. Add the rest of the remaining ingredients to your ham stock. If you have ham boullion cubes or hambase, add a little of that, and also the tomato paste. Turn up the heat a bit and bring it to somewhat of a boil. Add salt/pepper per your preference.
6. Once the soup is boiling back off the heat again and let simmer for about 2 or 3 hours, until the beans just about begin to break up and the potatoes are soft. Stir often. 

**Enjoy!!!**
