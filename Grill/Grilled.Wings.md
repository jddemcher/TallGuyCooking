# Grilled Wings

*This recipe/marinade can be used for wings, thighs, and drumsticks. Size quantities are good for about 12-15 wings, 4-6 thighs, or 6-8 drumsticks. Marinade ingredients can be increased for larger quantity of chicken.*

### Ingredients

1. 1 tsp chili powder
2. 1 tsp paprika
3. 1 tsp black pepper
4. 1 tbsp italian herb seasoning
5. 1 tbsp garlic salt
6. 1 tsp red pepper flake
7. 1/4 cup olive oil
8. 1/3 cup apple cider vinegar
9. 2 tsp lime juice

### Cooking Instructions

1. Mix all ingredients together, place in gallon size freezer bag with the wings/chicken. Toss them around and make sure all are fully coated. Place in refridgerator for at least an hour, longer is better. 
2. Turn grill on medium heat, enough to get a good sear on the meat. Once an initial sear exists on each side, lower heat a bit, and slow cook the wings/chicken until skin is crispy. If you have extra marinade, you can baste every 5-10 minutes. This will take roughly 40 minutes, more or less depending on grill heat and desired crispiness.

**Enjoy!!!**
