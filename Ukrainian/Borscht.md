# Borscht

*My version of Borscht inspired by Ukrainian recipe.*

### Ingredients
1. 4 beef short ribs
2. 1 tbsp kosher salt
3. 1/2 tbsp whole black peppercorn
4. 2 yellow onion
5. 4 large carrots
6. celery
7. garlic
8. green bell pepper
9. bay leaves
10. 4 large red beets
11. fresh parsely
12. red cabbage
13. green onions/scallions
14. tomato paste

### Cooking Instructions

1. Add the short ribs, salt, peppercorn, 1 onion, 2 large carrots, 2 large celery sticks (with leaves is fine), 4-5 garlic cloves, 1 green bell pepper, and 2 bay leaves to a large pot. Add water and bring to a simmer, cook for about 4 hours.
2. While the broth is simmering, take the remaining carrots, onions, celery, and red beets and chop/slice how you prefer. Saute them in a large skillet/pan on the stove top.
3. Once the veggies are cooked down a little, add the cabbage, parsely, some salt/pepper, green onions, and about 2 tbsp tomato paste.
4. After the broth is finished, remove the short ribs and strain the remaining vegetables, saving the broth.
5. Add the broth back to the pot, along with the cooked vegetables and beef short ribs (removing any fat/bones).
6. Simmer for about another hour or so.

Tip: If you prefer you can take half of the red beets and puree them to add more color/thickness to the broth.

**Enjoy!!!**
