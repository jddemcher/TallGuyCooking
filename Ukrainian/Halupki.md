# Halupki

*Halupki are Russian/Ukrainian/Polish origin food that are also referred to as 'stuffed cabbage' or 'pidgeons'. There are many variations of the dish and can be easily modified to your liking.*

### Ingredients

1. 3 small heads cabbage
2. 2 lbs ground beef
3. Salt & Pepper
4. 1 1/2 cup white rice
5. 1/4 cup instant barley
6. 1 small can tomato paste

### Cooking Instructions

1. Core the cabbage, removing the unusable root/core in center.
2. Fry off the ground beef, season with salt & pepper (can add other seasoning if desired). Do not strain grease. Stir in the rice and barley when beef is fully cooked, then set aside.
3. Place cabbage heads in pot of boiling water, when leaves begin to fall off the cabbage core, remove from pot and place on plate. Allow them to cool enough to be handled, and remove/slice/filet off the larger portion of the center rib in each leaf. 
4. Prepare a large baking dish that has a lid. Line the bottom of the pan with the larger cabbage leaves that are not good for rolling.
5. Take the tomato paste and mix with water until it has a consistency similar to ketchup.
6. Take each leaf, and place a heaping spoonful (more if needed) into the center. Roll each leaf similar to a burrito style wrap, and neatly place them in the baking dish. For each layer, cover with the tomato mixture, and then separate each layer of Halupki with some of the extra cabbage.
7. Bake them in the oven at 325 degrees for 90 minutes.

**Enjoy!!!**
