# Bread and Butter Pickles

*Makes 4 pints of pickles, can be either prepped for long term canning or short batch refridgerator pickles. If canning for long term storage, it's best to use pint jars.*

### Ingredients

1. 6-8 medium sized pickling cucumbers sliced into 1/4 slices
2. 1 medium/small onion (sweet or yellow) thin sliced
3. 1/2 cup kosher salt
4. 3 cups white vinegar
5. 2 cups granulated sugar
6. 2 tbsp mustard seed
7. 1 tsp celery seed
8. 1 tsp ground tumeric

### Cooking Instructions

1. Spread the cucumbers out on a large shallow plate or bowl, spread the salt over the slices and refridgerate for roughly 2 hours.
2. If planning to long term store, prepare the water bath canner. Jars should sit on a wire rack, not directly on bottom of pot. 1-2 inches of water should cover jars when fully submerged.
3. Bring the vinegar, sugar, mustard seed, celery seed, and turmeric to a boil, stirring often.
4. Strain and rinse the cucumbers, washing most of the salt off, let them drain thoroughly.
5. Layer the bottom of each jar with some sliced onion, and then fill the jars with the cucumber slices. Pack tightly without forcing. (you can gently tap the jar on your counter to help pack the cucumbers without forcing)
6. Fill each jar with the brine, leave about 1/2 inch head space.
7. Wipe down the mouth of the jar, put lids on finger tight.
8. If you're just making a refridgerator batch, let the jars cool and then place in fridge. If canning, move on to next step.
9. Bring your pot of water for the canning bath to a boil, place jars in boiling water (with 1-2 inches of water above lids). Process for 15 minutes.
10. Remove the jars, let cool for about 1-2 hours. You should hear the seals pop as they cool, but also check by removing the ring and verifying the lid has sealed. If any do not seal, refridgerate those and consume them first.

**Enjoy!!!**
