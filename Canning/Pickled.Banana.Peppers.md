# Pickled Banana Peppers

*Makes 3 or 4 pints depending on how tightly jars are packed.*

### Ingredients

1. 2 cups white vinegar
2. 2 cups apple cider vinegar
3. 1 cup sugar
4. 1 tsp mustard seed
5. 1 tsp celery seed
6. 1-2 lbs banana peppers seeded and sliced into rings

### Cooking Instructions

1. Pack the sliced peppers into jars.
2. Bring the vinegar and dry ingredients to a boil.
3. Pour brine over peppers leaving 1/2" space at top.
4. Wipe lids and place on jars, finger tight.
5. If you're just making a refridgerator batch, let the jars cool and then place in fridge. If canning, move on to next step.
6. Bring your pot of water for the canning bath to a boil, place jars in boiling water (with 1-2 inches of water above lids). Process for 15 minutes.
7. Remove the jars, let cool for about 1-2 hours. You should hear the seals pop as they cool, but also check by removing the ring and verifying the lid has sealed. If any do not seal, refridgerate those and consume them first.

**Enjoy!!!**
