# Frank's Red Hot (copycat recipe)

*This is an attempted copycat recipe of the popular Frank's Red Hot sauce.*

### Ingredients

1. 18-20 fresh cayenne peppers (stems removed)
2. 1 1/2 cups white vinegar
3. 2 large garlic cloves, minced
4. 1 tsp kosher salt
5. 1 tsp garlic powder
6. 1 tsp paprika
7. 1 tbsp lime juice

### Cooking Instructions

1. Place all ingredients in sauce pan and bring to a boil over medium heat.
2. Once boiling, reduce heat and simmer for 20-25 minutes.
3. Remove mixture from heat, place in blender and puree until thick and smooth.
4. Transfer back to saucepan, and simmer for another 15 minutes.
5. Pour the sauce into pint sized canning jars.
6. If you're just making a refridgerator batch, let the jars cool and then place in fridge. If canning, move on to next step.
7. Bring your pot of water for the canning bath to a boil, place jars in boiling water (with 1-2 inches of water above lids). Process for 15 minutes.
8. Remove the jars, let cool for about 1-2 hours. You should hear the seals pop as they cool, but also check by removing the ring and verifying the lid has sealed. If any do not seal, refridgerate those and consume them first.

**Enjoy!!!**
